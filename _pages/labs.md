## ðŸŽ“ Cyber Shujaa Program
*Cloud and Network Security*
Student No: CS-CNS09-25039

I was selected for the Cloud & Network Security track whose training period is 12 weeks, starting Monday 12th May 2025 to Friday 1st August 2025. 
Training sessions are scheduled for Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, with morning sessions running from 9:00 am to 11:00 am and evening sessions from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm.

**Overview**
This activity provides  a constructive guided learning approach, that I can practice my learnings in HTB Academy. The content is structured with hands-on exercises to continuous culminate my skills reproduce the sections, as well as tackle real scenarios on various concepts.

**Approach**
I created an account with HTB Academy, searched on getting started with Intro to HTB Academy to kickstart the module and navigaed through the module noting the theory and doing the practical hands-on exercises. 

The main tool used was readily available at HTB Academy.

**Key Lessons**
This activity shared a comprehensive guide on working within the HTB Academy. This has greatly nurtured my navigation process as I complete both the theory and practical sections within different modules and obtain certifications through exercises preparing me for specific roles in the cyber security market. I intend to complete my paths as per the durations available to advance my skills and obtain badges that I can share with my LinkedIn network. In the long-run, I will inspire colleagues within the technology sector to take advantage of the CyberShujaa Scholarship program and becoming certified cyber security practitioners.

**Overview**
This activity provides introduced network traffic analysis in a general sense for my offensive and defensive security practice. As a defender I was able to examining network traffic to characterize common ports and protocols utilized, establish a baseline for our environment, monitor and respond to threats, and ensure the greatest possible insight into our organization's network. 

**Approach**
Upon unclocking the module Network Traffic Analysis in HTB Academy, I navigated through the OSIL model and TCP/IP model and did comprehensive practical lab exercises. Also the theory questions tested my learnings with ease.

The main exercise entailed pawning the target and running it on VMWare.

**Key Lessons**
This activity  enlightened me on trafficking and finding problems. That, I start with standard protocols first and work my way into the austere and specific only to the organization. Then I should study major patterns and check anything hosts to host within our network. All this can be possible if I can identify unique events and ask for help where necessary then utilize tools such as tcpdump and Wireshark. In my career journey, this knowledge will impact my network problem-solving skills, significantly contribute to reliable network systems, and prepare me for a CCNA certification exam upon completion of this cyber security program.

**Overview**
Throughout this module, I got to understand the topic of HTTP web requests and how different web applications utilize them to communicate with their backends. As a result of intending to 
be successful in information security, and later in web application penetration testing, how web applications work is crucial even before attempting to do any attacks.  

**Approach**
There were two main tools I was working with in this model i.e. the cURL and the Browser DevTools. Together with the hands-on exercises that I managed to complete them with the 
relevant commands to support my cyber security journey. 

**Key Lessons**
This hands-on module really impacted my start with penetration testing. I have the ability to run HTTP requests and retrieve responses while learning the segments of network. 
Additonally, I have worked with the four common HTTP Methods, GET, PUT, POST and DELETE in various hands-on labs. This experience has ignited my passion to perform different 
operations on database entities. This I believe has played a significant role in my learning journey as a cybersecurity student.
